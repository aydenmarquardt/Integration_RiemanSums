/* 
 * This class holds methods that were talked about during my discrete math class
 * 
 * A fibonacci sequence that uses recursion
 * 
 * A custon psudo random number generator one with seeding and one without
 * 
 * Matrix Math
 * 
 * Euclids Algorithm
 * 
 * More info found in docs (not added yet)
 * 
 * Will use some of these in the other Differentation and Integration classes
